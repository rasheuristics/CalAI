# Voice Settings Implementation Complete ✅

## Overview
The iOS voice settings feature has been fully implemented, allowing users to customize how the AI assistant sounds when using voice output.

---

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Voice Selection**
**Location:** Settings → AI Settings → Voice

- Browse all iOS system voices organized by language
- Voices sorted by quality (Premium → Enhanced → Standard)
- Shows voice name and quality level
- "System Default" option
- Tap any voice to hear a preview
- Selected voice indicated with checkmark

**Implementation:**
```swift
VoiceSelectionView
├── System Default option
└── Grouped by language sections
    └── Voice list with quality labels
```

### 2. **Speech Speed Control**
**Location:** Settings → AI Settings → Speed Slider

- Range: 0.3x to 0.7x (matches AVSpeechUtterance defaults)
- Step: 0.05x increments
- Shows current speed value (e.g., "0.5x")
- Changes save automatically via @AppStorage

### 3. **Speech Pitch Control**
**Location:** Settings → AI Settings → Pitch Slider

- Range: 0.5x to 2.0x
- Step: 0.1x increments
- Shows current pitch value (e.g., "1.0x")
- Changes save automatically via @AppStorage

### 4. **Test Voice Button**
**Location:** Settings → AI Settings → Test Voice

- Plays sample text with current settings
- Text: "Hello, this is a test of the voice settings."
- Uses selected voice, speed, and pitch
- Allows instant feedback before committing

### 5. **AI Output Mode** (Already Existed)
**Location:** Settings → AI Settings → Output Mode

Three options:
- **Text Only:** AI responses shown as text only
- **Voice & Text:** AI responses shown AND spoken
- **Voice Only:** AI responses spoken without text display

---

## Technical Implementation

### Data Persistence
All settings stored in UserDefaults via @AppStorage:

```swift
@AppStorage(UserDefaults.Keys.speechVoiceIdentifier)
private var voiceIdentifier: String = ""

@AppStorage(UserDefaults.Keys.speechRate)
private var speechRate: Double = AVSpeechUtteranceDefaultSpeechRate

@AppStorage(UserDefaults.Keys.speechPitch)
private var speechPitch: Double = 1.0

@AppStorage(UserDefaults.Keys.aiOutputMode)
private var aiOutputMode: AIOutputMode = .voiceAndText
```

### SpeechManager Integration
Settings automatically connect to the existing `SpeechManager`:

```swift
class SpeechManager: NSObject, AVSpeechSynthesizerDelegate {
    @AppStorage(UserDefaults.Keys.speechVoiceIdentifier)
    private var voiceIdentifier: String = ""

    @AppStorage(UserDefaults.Keys.speechRate)
    private var speechRate: Double = AVSpeechUtteranceDefaultSpeechRate

    @AppStorage(UserDefaults.Keys.speechPitch)
    private var speechPitch: Double = 1.0

    func speak(text: String, completion: (() -> Void)? = nil) {
        let utterance = AVSpeechUtterance(string: text)
        utterance.voice = AVSpeechSynthesisVoice(identifier: voiceIdentifier)
        utterance.rate = Float(speechRate)
        utterance.pitchMultiplier = Float(speechPitch)
        synthesizer.speak(utterance)
    }
}
```

### Voice Organization
Voices are grouped and sorted for better UX:

1. **Group by Language:** English, Spanish, French, etc.
2. **Sort by Quality:** Premium > Enhanced > Standard
3. **Sort by Name:** Alphabetically within each quality tier

---

## User Experience Flow

### Selecting a Voice:
1. User opens Settings → AI Settings
2. Taps "Voice" row (shows current: "System Default" or voice name)
3. VoiceSelectionView appears with all voices
4. User browses by language
5. Taps a voice to hear preview: "Hello, this is [Voice Name]"
6. Voice is immediately selected and saved
7. Returns to AI Settings

### Adjusting Speed/Pitch:
1. User opens Settings → AI Settings
2. Drags Speed slider (sees "0.5x" value update in real-time)
3. Drags Pitch slider (sees "1.2x" value update in real-time)
4. Taps "Test Voice" button
5. Hears sample with new settings
6. Adjusts further if needed

### Using in Conversation:
1. User asks AI a question via voice or text
2. AI processes and responds
3. If Output Mode is "Voice Only" or "Voice & Text":
   - SpeechManager.shared.speak() is called
   - Response is spoken using saved voice/speed/pitch settings
4. If Output Mode is "Text Only":
   - No speech, only text appears

## Edge Cases Handled

1. **Empty Voice Identifier:** Falls back to system default
2. **Invalid Voice Identifier:** Falls back to system default
3. **Rate/Pitch Out of Range:** Clamped by slider bounds
4. **No Voices Available:** Shows "System Default" only
5. **Speech Interruption:** Stops previous speech before starting new

## Alignment with Original Design Discussion

The implementation matches the theoretical design from the conversation:

✅ **Voice Choice:** User can select from all iOS voices
✅ **Speed Control:** Slider for speech rate (0.3x - 0.7x)
✅ **Frequency (Pitch):** Slider for pitch multiplier (0.5x - 2.0x)
✅ **Three Output Modes:** Text Only, Voice & Text, Voice Only
✅ **Test Functionality:** "Test Voice" button for instant feedback
✅ **Persistence:** All settings saved in UserDefaults
✅ **Immediate Application:** Settings apply without restart

**Additional Features Added:**
- Voice preview when selecting
- Quality indicators (Premium/Enhanced/Standard)
- Language-grouped voice list
- Real-time value display on sliders
- Integration with existing SpeechManager

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

1. **Voice Confirmation in Voice Only Mode**
   - Implement "So you want me to..." confirmation flow
   - Add yes/no recognition for confirmations
   - Store pending command during confirmation state

2. **Custom Test Phrases**
   - Allow user to type custom test text
   - Save favorite test phrases

3. **Voice Favorites**
   - Star frequently used voices
   - Quick access section at top

4. **Pronunciation Dictionary**
   - Custom pronunciations for names/terms
   - Phonetic spelling override

5. **Emotion/Expression**
   - Vary rate/pitch based on context
   - Excited, sad, serious tones

## Summary

The voice settings feature is **fully functional** and ready for use. Users can now:

1. ✅ Choose any iOS system voice
2. ✅ Adjust speech speed (0.3x - 0.7x)
3. ✅ Adjust speech pitch (0.5x - 2.0x)
4. ✅ Test settings before applying
5. ✅ Select output mode (Text/Voice/Both)
6. ✅ Have settings persist across app restarts

All settings are automatically applied to AI responses via the existing `SpeechManager` integration.
