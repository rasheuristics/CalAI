## Known Limitations

### 1. Analytics Platform Integration
- **Current:** Local-only logging to Documents directory
- **Future:** Firebase Analytics or Mixpanel integration
- **Status:** Integration points are commented in code (line 67: "TODO: Send to analytics platform")

### 2. Log File Rotation
- **Current:** Single log file grows indefinitely
- **Future:** Implement log rotation (max file size, max file age)
- **Impact:** Log file could grow large with heavy usage

### 3. Network Sync
- **Current:** Analytics data is local-only
- **Future:** Optional cloud sync for analytics data
- **Privacy:** Would require additional user consent

---

## Common Issues

### Issue 1: Analytics settings not visible
**Cause:** AdvancedSettingsView.swift not updated
**Solution:** Verify NavigationLink for Analytics exists in Privacy & Security section

### Issue 2: Events not logging
**Cause:** Analytics is disabled
**Solution:** Enable analytics in settings

### Issue 3: Export shows "No analytics data available"
**Cause:** No events logged yet, or log file cleared
**Solution:** Use app to generate events, then export

---
