# Task Badge on Tab Icon

**Date**: 2025-10-21
**Status**: ✅ **Implemented**

---

## 🎯 Feature Summary

Added a **badge counter** to the Tasks tab icon showing the number of active (incomplete) tasks. The badge appears as a small red circle with a number in the top-right corner of the inbox icon.

---

## ✨ What Changed

### Before
- Tasks tab had inbox icon with no indicator
- No visual feedback about pending tasks

### After
- **Badge shows active task count**
- Badge only appears when count > 0
- Updates in real-time as tasks are completed/added
- Red badge with white text (iOS standard)

---

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### Changes Made to ContentView.swift

**1. Added EventTaskManager (Line 13)**
```swift
@StateObject private var taskManager = EventTaskManager.shared
```

**2. Added Active Task Count Computed Property (Lines 20-27)**
```swift
// Computed property for active task count
private var activeTaskCount: Int {
    var count = 0
    for eventTasks in taskManager.eventTasks.values {
        count += eventTasks.tasks.filter { !$0.isCompleted }.count
    }
    return count
}
```

**3. Added Badge to Tasks Tab (Line 67)**
```swift
.badge(activeTaskCount > 0 ? activeTaskCount : nil)
```

---

## 📊 How It Works

### Active Task Calculation
1. Iterates through all events in `taskManager.eventTasks`
2. For each event, filters tasks where `isCompleted == false`
3. Sums up all incomplete tasks across all events
4. Returns total count

### Badge Display Logic
- **If count > 0**: Shows badge with number
- **If count == 0**: No badge (nil hides the badge)
- Badge automatically updates when:
  - Tasks are added
  - Tasks are completed
  - Tasks are deleted

### Real-Time Updates
- `@StateObject private var taskManager` ensures SwiftUI reactivity
- When `taskManager.eventTasks` changes, `activeTaskCount` recalculates
- Badge updates automatically via SwiftUI's reactive system

---

## 🎨 Visual Appearance

### Badge Style
- **Color**: Red background (system standard)
- **Text**: White number
- **Position**: Top-right corner of tab icon
- **Size**: Automatically sized by iOS
- **Shape**: Circular

### Example Display
```
┌─────────────┐
│  📥        3│  ← Badge showing 3 active tasks
│   Tasks     │
└─────────────┘
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Scenarios

**Test 1: No Active Tasks**
1. Complete all tasks or start with empty tasks
2. Check Tasks tab icon
3. **Expected**: No badge visible

**Test 2: Add Active Tasks**
1. Add 5 new tasks (don't complete them)
2. Check Tasks tab icon
3. **Expected**: Badge shows "5"

**Test 3: Complete Tasks**
1. Start with 5 active tasks (badge shows "5")
2. Complete 2 tasks
3. Check Tasks tab icon
4. **Expected**: Badge updates to "3"

**Test 4: Delete Tasks**
1. Start with 3 active tasks (badge shows "3")
2. Delete 1 task
3. Check Tasks tab icon
4. **Expected**: Badge updates to "2"

**Test 5: All Tasks Completed**
1. Start with 2 active tasks (badge shows "2")
2. Complete both tasks
3. Check Tasks tab icon
4. **Expected**: Badge disappears (count = 0)

**Test 6: Real-Time Update**
1. View Tasks tab with badge showing "4"
2. Switch to another tab
3. Complete a task from event detail
4. Switch back to view tab bar
5. **Expected**: Badge now shows "3"

## 💡 Badge Logic Breakdown

```swift
.badge(activeTaskCount > 0 ? activeTaskCount : nil)
```

**Explanation**:
- **`activeTaskCount > 0`** - Check if there are active tasks
- **`? activeTaskCount`** - If yes, show the count
- **`: nil`** - If no, pass nil (hides badge)

**Why nil instead of 0?**
- SwiftUI's `.badge()` modifier hides badge when value is `nil`
- Passing `0` would show a badge with "0" (not desired)
- Passing `nil` removes badge entirely (desired behavior)

## 🔄 Badge Update Flow

### When Task is Added
1. User adds new task in Tasks tab
2. `taskManager.addTask()` called
3. `taskManager.eventTasks` updates (published property)
4. SwiftUI detects change
5. `activeTaskCount` recalculates
6. Badge updates with new count

### When Task is Completed
1. User taps checkbox on task
2. `taskManager.toggleTaskCompletion()` called
3. Task's `isCompleted` property changes
4. `taskManager.eventTasks` updates (published property)
5. SwiftUI detects change
6. `activeTaskCount` recalculates (filters out completed)
7. Badge decrements

### When Task is Deleted
1. User swipes and deletes task
2. `taskManager.deleteTask()` called
3. `taskManager.eventTasks` updates
4. `activeTaskCount` recalculates
5. Badge decrements

## 📱 iOS Badge Behavior

### Standard iOS Badge Features
- Automatically positioned in top-right corner
- Size scales with number of digits:
  - 1-9: Small circle
  - 10-99: Wider oval
  - 100+: Even wider
- Red background (system standard for notifications/counts)
- White text for contrast
- Accessible (VoiceOver announces count)

### Accessibility
- Badge count announced by VoiceOver
- Example: "Tasks, 5 active items"
- Meets iOS accessibility guidelines

---

## 🎯 Use Cases

### Scenario 1: Daily Task Management
- User starts day with 10 tasks
- Badge shows "10"
- User completes tasks throughout day
- Badge decrements: 10 → 7 → 5 → 2 → 0
- Badge disappears when all complete

### Scenario 2: Quick Glance
- User wants to know task count without opening tab
- Looks at tab bar
- Badge shows "3" - knows 3 tasks pending
- Can decide whether to address now or later

### Scenario 3: Task Motivation
- Seeing decreasing badge number provides satisfaction
- Visual feedback of progress
- Gamification element (reduce to zero)

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

### 1. Badge Color Options
Allow user to customize badge color:
```swift
// Could add in settings
enum BadgeColor {
    case red    // Default (urgent/active)
    case orange // Warning
    case blue   // Info
}
```

### 2. Badge for Overdue Tasks
Show different badge for overdue tasks:
```swift
private var overdueTaskCount: Int {
    // Count tasks where dueDate < Date() && !isCompleted
}

// Display with different color or icon
```

### 3. Badge Breakdown
Show badge with breakdown (e.g., "3/10" for 3 high priority out of 10 total):
```swift
private var highPriorityCount: Int {
    // Count tasks where priority == .high && !isCompleted
}

.badge("\(highPriorityCount)/\(activeTaskCount)")
```

### 4. Animated Badge Updates
Add subtle animation when count changes:
```swift
.badge(activeTaskCount > 0 ? activeTaskCount : nil)
.animation(.spring(), value: activeTaskCount)
```

### 5. Badge Hiding Setting
Allow users to hide badge in settings:
```swift
@AppStorage("showTaskBadge") private var showTaskBadge = true

.badge(showTaskBadge && activeTaskCount > 0 ? activeTaskCount : nil)
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Performance Considerations
- **Efficient Calculation**: Only counts incomplete tasks (filtered)
- **Cached via Computed Property**: Recalculates only when dependencies change
- **SwiftUI Optimization**: Updates only when `taskManager.eventTasks` changes

### Memory Impact
- **Minimal**: Single `@StateObject` for task manager (shared instance)
- **Computed Property**: No stored value, calculates on demand
- **Badge Display**: Native iOS component, no custom rendering

### Data Consistency
- Badge count always accurate
- Synced with actual task state
- No race conditions (single source of truth)
