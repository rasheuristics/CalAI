# Horizontal Lane Snapping

**Date**: 2025-10-21
**Status**: ✅ **Implemented**

---

## 🎯 Feature Summary

Added **snap-to-lane** behavior for horizontal dragging. When you drag an event left or right, it now snaps to each of the **5 lane positions** as soon as it crosses a lane boundary.

---

## ✨ What Changed

### Before
- Horizontal drag was only used for week view (day-to-day movement)
- In day view, horizontal drag did nothing or triggered swipe actions
- No way to move events between lanes

### After
- **Day view**: Horizontal drag snaps to 5 lane positions (lanes 0-4)
- **Week view**: Still uses day-to-day movement (unchanged)
- Events snap immediately when crossing lane boundaries
- Visual feedback as you drag

---

## 🔧 How It Works

### Lane Grid

The screen is divided into **5 equal lanes**:

```
Screen width: 390px (iPhone 14 example)
Lane width: 390 / 5 = 78px per lane

|---Lane 0---|---Lane 1---|---Lane 2---|---Lane 3---|---Lane 4---|
|    78px    |    78px    |    78px    |    78px    |    78px    |
```

### Snapping Logic

```swift
let maxLanes = 5
let laneWidth = width / CGFloat(maxLanes)  // 78px

// Calculate which lane based on drag distance
let laneChange = floor((translation / laneWidth) + 0.5)

// Snap to that lane position
horizontalDragOffset = laneChange * laneWidth
```

**Example**:
- Start in Lane 0
- Drag right 40px (halfway through Lane 1)
  - `laneChange = floor((40 / 78) + 0.5) = floor(1.01) = 1`
  - Snaps to Lane 1 position (78px offset)
- Drag right another 40px (total 80px, past Lane 1 midpoint)
  - `laneChange = floor((80 / 78) + 0.5) = floor(1.53) = 1`
  - Still Lane 1 (need to cross midpoint to snap to Lane 2)
- Drag right to 120px (into Lane 2)
  - `laneChange = floor((120 / 78) + 0.5) = floor(2.04) = 2`
  - Snaps to Lane 2 position (156px offset)

### Snap Threshold

Events snap when they cross the **midpoint** of the next lane:
- To snap from Lane 0 to Lane 1: drag > 39px (half of 78px)
- To snap from Lane 1 to Lane 2: drag > 117px (1.5 * 78px)
- And so on...

## 📐 Technical Implementation

### 1. Horizontal Drag Detection (Lines 2539-2550)

```swift
} else {
    // Horizontal drag for LANE snapping (day view - 5 lanes)
    let maxLanes = 5
    let laneWidth = width / CGFloat(maxLanes)

    // Calculate which lane we're closest to based on drag translation
    let laneChange = floor((value.translation.width / laneWidth) + 0.5)

    // Snap to lane positions
    horizontalDragOffset = laneChange * laneWidth

    print("📍 Lateral drag: \(value.translation.width)px → Lane offset: \(laneChange) → Snapped: \(horizontalDragOffset)px")
}
```

**Key points**:
- Uses same `floor(x + 0.5)` rounding as vertical snapping
- Calculates lane offset relative to event's current lane
- Immediately snaps - no "dead zone"

### 2. Drag End Handling (Lines 2592-2614)

```swift
} else {
    // Handle lane change in day view
    let maxLanes = 5
    let laneWidth = width / CGFloat(maxLanes)
    let laneChange = Int(floor((value.translation.width / laneWidth) + 0.5))

    if laneChange != 0 {
        // Calculate new lane (bounded to 0-4)
        let newLane = max(0, min(4, event.lane + laneChange))
        print("🎯 Lane change: \(event.lane) → \(newLane) (offset: \(laneChange))")

        // Save the lane change
        handleLaneChange(newLane: newLane)
        hasBeenMoved = true

        // KEEP horizontalDragOffset - event stays at new lane
    } else {
        print("🎯 No lane change, reverting")
        withAnimation {
            horizontalDragOffset = 0
        }
    }
}
```

**Key points**:
- Calculates final lane (bounded to 0-4)
- Saves lane change via notification
- Event stays at new position (doesn't snap back)

### 3. Lane Change Handler (Lines 2730-2747)

```swift
private func handleLaneChange(newLane: Int) {
    print("🎯 Event lane changed to: \(newLane)")

    // Post notification to update the event's lane in the calendar system
    NotificationCenter.default.post(
        name: NSNotification.Name("UpdateEventLane"),
        object: nil,
        userInfo: [
            "eventId": event.id,
            "newLane": newLane,
            "source": event.source
        ]
    )

    print("📤 Posted lane change notification for event: \(event.title ?? "Untitled")")
}
```

**Note**: Currently posts notification for future implementation. Lane changes are visual only and will be recalculated when view rebuilds based on time overlaps.

## 🎨 User Experience

### Scenario 1: Move Event One Lane Right

**Setup**: Event in Lane 0, drag right

1. **Start drag**: Event at Lane 0 position
2. **Drag 10px**: Still Lane 0 (not past midpoint)
3. **Drag 40px**: **Snaps to Lane 1** (crossed midpoint at 39px)
4. **Release**: Event stays at Lane 1 ✓

**Console output**:
```
📍 Lateral drag: 10.0px → Lane offset: 0.0 → Snapped: 0.0px
📍 Lateral drag: 40.0px → Lane offset: 1.0 → Snapped: 78.0px
🔴 Touch ended
🎯 Lane change: 0 → 1 (offset: 1)
📤 Posted lane change notification for event: Team Meeting
```

### Scenario 2: Move Event Two Lanes Left

**Setup**: Event in Lane 2, drag left

1. **Start drag**: Event at Lane 2 position
2. **Drag -80px**: **Snaps to Lane 1** (crossed first midpoint)
3. **Drag -160px**: **Snaps to Lane 0** (crossed second midpoint)
4. **Release**: Event stays at Lane 0 ✓

### Scenario 3: Small Drag (No Lane Change)

**Setup**: Event in Lane 1, drag slightly

1. **Drag 20px**: Still Lane 1 (not past midpoint)
2. **Release**: Event snaps back to original position ✓

**Console output**:
```
📍 Lateral drag: 20.0px → Lane offset: 0.0 → Snapped: 0.0px
🔴 Touch ended
🎯 No lane change, reverting
```

### Scenario 4: Drag Beyond Boundaries

**Setup**: Event in Lane 4 (rightmost), drag right

1. **Drag 100px**: Would calculate Lane 5
2. **Clamped to Lane 4**: `max(0, min(4, 4 + 1)) = 4`
3. **No change**: Event stays at Lane 4

## 🧪 Testing

### Test 1: Single Lane Move
1. Long-press event in Lane 0
2. Drag right ~40-50px (past first midpoint)
3. Observe: Event snaps to Lane 1 position
4. Release
5. Verify: Event stays at Lane 1

### Test 2: Multi-Lane Move
1. Long-press event in Lane 0
2. Drag right ~200px (across multiple lanes)
3. Observe: Event snaps through Lane 1 → Lane 2 as you drag
4. Release
5. Verify: Event stays at final lane

### Test 3: Bidirectional Drag
1. Long-press event in Lane 2 (middle)
2. Drag left to Lane 0
3. Drag right to Lane 4
4. Drag back to Lane 2
5. Release
6. Verify: Event at Lane 2

### Test 4: Boundary Protection
1. Long-press event in Lane 0 (leftmost)
2. Drag left 100px (would be negative lane)
3. Observe: Event stays at Lane 0 (bounded)
4. Same test with Lane 4 dragging right

### Expected Console Logs

📤 Posted lane change notification for event: Team Meeting
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Lane Changes Are Currently Visual Only

The `handleLaneChange` function posts a notification, but lane assignment is **automatically recalculated** based on time overlaps when the view rebuilds.

**This means**:
- You can drag an event to Lane 3
- But if it doesn't overlap with other events, it will jump back to Lane 0 on next rebuild
- **Future enhancement**: Persist lane preferences in metadata

### Lane Assignment Algorithm

Currently, lanes are auto-assigned by the `assignLanes` function based on time overlaps:
- First event → Lane 0
- If overlaps with Lane 0 event → Lane 1
- If overlaps with Lanes 0 & 1 → Lane 2
- Etc.

**Horizontal drag allows temporary override**, but automatic algorithm will reassign on rebuild.

### Week View Unchanged

Week view still uses horizontal drag for **day-to-day movement** (e.g., Monday → Tuesday). The lane snapping **only applies to day view**.

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

### 1. Persist Lane Preferences
Store user's manual lane assignments in event metadata:
```swift
// Save to UserDefaults or Core Data
eventLanePreferences[eventId] = newLane
```

### 2. Visual Lane Grid
Show faint vertical lines indicating lane boundaries during drag:
```swift
// Add overlay during drag
if isDragging && dragDirection == .horizontal {
    laneGridOverlay()
}
```

### 3. Haptic Feedback
Trigger haptic when crossing lane boundaries:
```swift
if currentLane != previousLane {
    UIImpactFeedbackGenerator(style: .light).impactOccurred()
}
```

### 4. Lane Lock Mode
Allow user to lock events to specific lanes:
```swift
// Prevent auto-reassignment for locked events
if event.isLaneLocked {
    return event.manualLane
}
```
