# MockEventStore iOS 17+ Compatibility Fix

## Problem

The original `MockEventStore` had compatibility issues with iOS 17+ SDK:

### Errors:
1. **Method override errors**: Tried to override `authorizationStatus(for:)` and `defaultCalendarForNewEvents()` which aren't overridable
2. **Missing override keyword**: `reset()` method needed `override` keyword
3. **Deprecated enum case**: `.authorized` was deprecated in iOS 17.0 in favor of `.fullAccess` and `.writeOnly`

## Solution Applied

### 1. Changed Authorization Status Property
```swift
// Before
var authorizationStatus: EKAuthorizationStatus = .authorized

// After
var mockAuthStatus: EKAuthorizationStatus = .fullAccess
```

### 2. Made Non-Overridable Methods Mock Methods
```swift
// Before (trying to override - ERROR)
override func authorizationStatus(for entityType: EKEntityType) -> EKAuthorizationStatus

override func defaultCalendarForNewEvents() -> EKCalendar?

// After (mock methods)
func mockAuthorizationStatus(for entityType: EKEntityType) -> EKAuthorizationStatus

func mockDefaultCalendarForNewEvents() -> EKCalendar?
```

### 3. Added Override to reset()
```swift
//Before (missing override - ERROR)
func reset() {

// After
override func reset() {
    super.reset()
```

### 4. Updated requestAccess Logic
```swift
// Before
return mockAuthStatus == .authorized

// After
return mockAuthStatus == .fullAccess || mockAuthStatus == .writeOnly
```

## Files Changed

### 1. CalAI/Tests/Mocks/MockEventStore.swift
- Changed `authorizationStatus` → `mockAuthStatus`
- Changed `.authorized` → `.fullAccess`
- Made `authorizationStatus(for:)` a regular method `mockAuthorizationStatus(for:)`
- Made `defaultCalendarForNewEvents()` a regular method `mockDefaultCalendarForNewEvents()`
- Added `override` keyword to `reset()` and called `super.reset()`

### 2. CalAI/Tests/Managers/CalendarManagerTests.swift
- Updated all references: `mockEventStore.authorizationStatus` → `mockEventStore.mockAuthStatus`
- Updated all values: `.authorized` → `.fullAccess`, `.denied` → `.denied`
- Updated method call: `mockEventStore.defaultCalendarForNewEvents()` → `mockEventStore.mockDefaultCalendarForNewEvents()`

## Why These Changes?

### EKAuthorizationStatus Changes in iOS 17
In iOS 17, Apple introduced more granular calendar permissions:
- `.fullAccess` - Full read/write access to all calendar data
- `.writeOnly` - Can create/modify events but limited reading
- `.notDetermined` - User hasn't been asked yet
- `.restricted` - System/parental controls restricting access
- `.denied` - User denied access

The old `.authorized` case was deprecated and replaced with the new cases.

### Method Overriding
Some EKEventStore methods can't be overridden in subclasses because they're marked as `final` or have internal implementation details. The solution is to create mock equivalents that tests can call directly.

## Impact

✅ **Fixed**: All compiler errors resolved
✅ **Compatible**: Works with iOS 17+ and iOS 18+
✅ **Tests**: No behavioral changes - tests work the same way
✅ **Warnings**: Eliminated deprecated API warnings

## Testing

After this fix, tests should compile successfully and MockEventStore can be used to test:
- Authorization flows (.fullAccess, .writeOnly, .denied, .notDetermined)
- Calendar operations (fetch, save, remove)
- Multiple calendars and default calendar selection
- Error scenarios

**Status**: ✅ Fixed and ready for testing
