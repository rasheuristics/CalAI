## üìä Code Structure

```swift
struct TasksTabView: View {
    // Managers
    @ObservedObject var fontManager: FontManager
    @ObservedObject var calendarManager: CalendarManager
    @StateObject private var taskManager = EventTaskManager.shared

    // Filter state
    @State private var selectedFilter: TaskFilter = .all

    var body: some View {
        NavigationView {
            ZStack {
                VStack {
                    filterTabs           // Filter chips
                    ScrollView {
                        allTasksSection  // Grouped tasks
                    }
                    if showingAddTask {
                        taskEntryView    // Inline entry
                    }

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Current Limitations

1. **Task Association Required**
   - All tasks must be associated with an event
   - New tasks attach to next upcoming event
   - If no upcoming events, task creation shows warning

2. **Event Deletion Impact**
   - Deleting an event deletes its tasks
   - This is by design in EventTaskManager

3. **Auto Lane Assignment**
   - Lane changes in calendar are visual only
   - Tasks tab is independent of lane positioning

### Why These Limitations?

- Current data model: `EventTaskManager.allEventTasks: [String: EventTasks]`
- Tasks keyed by eventId
- To support general tasks, would need data model change

### Workaround Ideas

1. **Create "General Tasks" Pseudo-Event**
   - Special event ID for non-event tasks
   - Hidden from calendar view

2. **Modify EventTaskManager**
   - Support `nil` eventId
   - Separate general tasks storage
