### 4. **Morning Briefing**
**Status:** ⚠️ Weather Integration Issues

**Current State:**
- Daily briefing generation working
- Events, suggestions, and UI fully functional
- Weather service implemented but encountering authentication issues

**Weather Service Architecture:**
```swift
WeatherService
├── Primary: WeatherKit (iOS 16+)
│   └── Error: JWT Authentication Error 2
└── Fallback: OpenWeatherMap API
    └── Error: 401 Invalid API Key
```

**Identified Issues:**

1. **WeatherKit Error 2:**
   - `WeatherDaemon.WDSJWTAuthenticatorServiceListener.Errors error 2`
   - Indicates provisioning profile doesn't include WeatherKit entitlement
   - Requires profile regeneration even though:
     - ✅ Paid Apple Developer Account
     - ✅ WeatherKit checked in Developer Portal
     - ✅ WeatherKit entitlement in CalAI.entitlements

2. **OpenWeatherMap Fallback:**
   - Demo API key `bf6b6c9842f882091a13f38933e2ce54` is invalid
   - Returns 401 Unauthorized
   - Needs user to provide their own key

**Enhanced Logging Added:**
```swift
- 🔴 WEATHER FETCH STARTED banner
- Detailed error domain, code, and userInfo
- iOS version detection
- Step-by-step WeatherKit attempt logging
- OpenWeatherMap fallback tracking
```

**Test Button:**
- Orange "Test Weather Fetch" button in Morning Briefing
- Shows detailed error alerts
- Helps diagnose permission and API issues

## 🐛 Known Issues

### **Critical:**
1. **WeatherKit Authentication Failure (Error 2)**
   - **Impact:** Weather not showing in Morning Briefing
   - **Cause:** Provisioning profile missing WeatherKit
   - **Solution:** Regenerate provisioning profile in Xcode or Developer Portal
   - **Workaround:** Configure personal OpenWeatherMap API key

### **Minor:**
2. **OpenWeatherMap Demo Key Invalid**
   - **Impact:** Fallback weather doesn't work
   - **Solution:** User must provide own API key
   - **Status:** By design - demo keys are limited

### **Console Logging:**
3. **Xcode Console Stopped Showing Logs**
   - **Fixed:** Script created (`fix_console.sh`)
   - **Steps:** Clear DerivedData, restart Xcode, check filter settings
