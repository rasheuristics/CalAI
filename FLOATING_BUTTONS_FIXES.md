# Floating Buttons Bug Fixes

## Issues Reported

1. ❌ **"What's Next" button** → On-device AI error message
2. ❌ **"Manage" button** → On-device AI error message
3. ❌ **"AI Insight" button** → Doesn't open anything

---

## Root Causes

### Issue 1 & 2: On-Device AI Context Window Errors

**Problem**:
Even after optimizing the context, the on-device Apple Intelligence model (4,096 token limit) was still encountering issues:
- Context might still be too large with multiple events
- On-device AI model might not be properly configured/available
- Error handling wasn't falling back to cloud AI properly

**Console Output**:
```
❌ OnDeviceAI error: exceededContextWindowSize
Content contains 4091 tokens, which exceeds the maximum allowed context size of 4096.
```

### Issue 3: AI Insight Card Not Appearing

**Problem**:
The card visibility condition was too restrictive:
```swift
// Before - Required showPatternInsights flag
if showPatternInsights, let patterns = aiPatterns, selectedActionCategory == .aiInsight {
    PatternConfidenceView(patterns: patterns)
}
```

The `showPatternInsights` flag was only set to `true` when `patterns.confidence != .none`, meaning users with fewer than 3 calendar events wouldn't see anything when tapping the button.

## Fixes Applied ✅

### Fix 1 & 2: Force Cloud AI (Temporary Solution)

**File**: `EnhancedConversationalAI.swift:120-136`

**Change**:
```swift
// BEFORE: Try on-device first
if #available(iOS 26.0, *), useOnDevice, let sessionObj = onDeviceSession {
    print("🍎 Using on-device Apple Intelligence")
    action = try await processWithOnDeviceAI(...)
} else {
    print("☁️ Using cloud AI fallback")
    action = try await aiService.processCommand(...)
}

// AFTER: Force cloud AI temporarily
let forceCloudAI = true

if #available(iOS 26.0, *), useOnDevice, !forceCloudAI, let sessionObj = onDeviceSession {
    print("🍎 Using on-device Apple Intelligence")
    action = try await processWithOnDeviceAI(...)
} else {
    print("☁️ Using cloud AI fallback")
    action = try await aiService.processCommand(...)
}
```

**Result**:
- ✅ "What's Next" button now works → Uses cloud AI
- ✅ "Manage" button now works → Uses cloud AI
- ✅ No more context window errors
- ✅ AI responds properly to queries

**Trade-off**:
- ⚠️ Loses on-device privacy benefit (temporary)
- ⚠️ Requires internet connection
- ⚠️ Slightly slower response time

**TODO**:
- Further optimize context for on-device AI
- Add dynamic context sizing based on available tokens
- Re-enable on-device AI once stable

---

### Fix 3: Always Show AI Insight Card

**File**: `AITabView.swift:993-1007 & 497`

**Change 1 - Always Load Patterns**:
```swift
// BEFORE: Only load if confidence != .none
if patterns.confidence != .none {
    aiPatterns = patterns
    showPatternInsights = true
} else {
    print("📊 Not enough calendar data for pattern insights yet")
}

// AFTER: Always load patterns
aiPatterns = patterns
showPatternInsights = true
print("🧠 Loaded AI pattern insights: \(patterns.confidence) with \(patterns.eventCount) events")
```

**Change 2 - Simplified Visibility Condition**:
```swift
// BEFORE: Required showPatternInsights flag
if showPatternInsights, let patterns = aiPatterns, selectedActionCategory == .aiInsight {
    PatternConfidenceView(patterns: patterns)
}

// AFTER: Only check button selection and patterns existence
if selectedActionCategory == .aiInsight, let patterns = aiPatterns {
    PatternConfidenceView(patterns: patterns)
}
```

**Result**:
- ✅ AI Insight button now shows card
- ✅ Works even with 0 calendar events
- ✅ PatternConfidenceView handles "no data" state internally
- ✅ Users see helpful message: "Not enough calendar data yet"

```

---

### After Fixes ✅

**Tapping "What's Next"**:
```
User taps [🔵 What's Next]
↓
Conversation opens
↓
☁️ Using cloud AI
↓
✅ AI responds: "You have 3 events next:

   - 6:00 PM Code Review"
↓
Button auto-deselects
↓
User happy - schedule shown correctly
```

**Tapping "Manage"**:
```
User taps [🟠 Manage]
↓
Conversation opens
↓
☁️ Using cloud AI
↓
✅ AI responds: "2 items need attention:
   ⚠️ Tuesday: 3 back-to-back meetings
   ⚠️ 'Client Call' has no location"
↓
Button auto-deselects
↓
User happy - attention items shown
```

**Tapping "AI Insight"**:
```
User taps [🟣 AI Insight]
↓
Button highlights (purple)
↓
✅ Card slides in from bottom
↓
Shows insights (or "Not enough data" message)
↓
User can read patterns
↓
Tap again to dismiss
↓
Card slides out
↓
User happy - can view/dismiss insights
```

## Build Status

## Future Improvements

### Short-term (To Re-enable On-Device AI)

1. **Dynamic Context Sizing**:
   ```swift
   // Adjust event count based on available tokens
   let maxEvents = eventCount > 50 ? 5 : 10
   let todaysEvents = events.filter { ... }.prefix(maxEvents)
   ```

2. **Ultra-Minimal Context for Simple Queries**:
   ```swift
   // For "What's next?" - only send next 3 events
   if message.contains("next") || message.contains("today") {
       return buildMinimalContext(events: events.prefix(3))
   }
   ```

3. **Token Counting**:
   ```swift
   // Estimate tokens and truncate if needed
   let estimatedTokens = prompt.count / 4  // Rough estimate
   if estimatedTokens > 3800 {
       // Truncate events or context
   }
   ```

4. **Smart Context Selection**:
   ```swift
   // Only include relevant events for the query
   if message.contains("next") {
       // Only upcoming events
   } else if message.contains("attention") {
       // Only events with issues
   }
   ```

### Long-term

1. **Hybrid Approach**: Use on-device for simple queries, cloud for complex
2. **Cached Patterns**: Pre-compute patterns, don't send in every request
3. **Streaming Responses**: Use streaming API to handle large contexts
4. **Model Selection**: Use smaller on-device model for simple queries

## How to Verify

1. **Open CalAI in Xcode**
2. **Run on simulator** (⌘R)
3. **Go to AI Tab**
4. **Test each button**:
   - Tap [🔵 What's Next] → Should show schedule
   - Tap [🟠 Manage] → Should show attention items
   - Tap [🟣 AI Insight] → Should show patterns card
5. **Check console** → Should see "☁️ Using cloud AI fallback"

All buttons should work without errors! 🎉
