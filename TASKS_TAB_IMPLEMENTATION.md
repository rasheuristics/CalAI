# Standalone Tasks Tab Implementation

**Date**: 2025-10-21
**Status**: ‚úÖ **Implemented**

---

## üéØ Feature Summary

Created a **standalone Tasks tab** in the main tab bar, separate from event-specific task management. This new tab provides a centralized view of all tasks across all events, with filtering and organization capabilities.

---

## ‚ú® What Changed

### Before
- Tasks were only accessible within event detail cards
- No global view of all tasks
- Tasks tied directly to specific events

### After
- **New standalone Tasks tab** in main tab bar
- **Inbox icon** (tray.fill) for the tab
- Shows all tasks across all events
- **Filter tabs**: All, Today, Upcoming, Completed
- Task count badges on filters
- Add tasks from the Tasks tab
- Tasks grouped by their associated events

---

## üîß Implementation Details

### 1. Code Added to EventTasksSystem.swift

**Location**: `/Users/btessema/Desktop/CalAI/CalAI/CalAI/EventTasksSystem.swift` (appended at line 3214+)

- `EventHeaderView` - Shows event context for each task group
- `FilterChip` - Filter buttons with icons and counts
- `TaskFilter` enum - All, Today, Upcoming, Completed

**Note**: The TasksTabView code was added to EventTasksSystem.swift to ensure it's included in the Xcode build target.

### 2. ContentView Updated

**Location**: `/Users/btessema/Desktop/CalAI/CalAI/CalAI/ContentView.swift`

**Changes**:
- Added Tasks tab between Events and Settings (line 51-56)
- Used `tray.fill` icon (inbox icon)
- Updated tab tags: Settings moved from tag(3) to tag(4)

**Tab Order**:

  - Event type icon
  - Event title
  - Event date/time
- Tasks listed under their associated event
- Tap task to edit details
- Swipe to delete
- Tap checkbox to toggle completion

### Add New Tasks

**Floating Plus Button**:

## üîÑ Data Flow

### Task Manager Integration

- Reads all tasks via `taskManager.allEventTasks`
- Filters tasks based on selected filter
- Groups tasks by event ID
- Toggles completion via `taskManager.toggleTaskCompletion()`
- Deletes tasks via `taskManager.deleteTask()`
- Adds tasks via `taskManager.addTask()`

### Calendar Manager Integration

Uses `CalendarManager`:
- Finds event details for task grouping
- Gets event title, date, type icon
- Identifies next upcoming event for new tasks

## üìä Code Structure

### TasksTabView Structure

```swift
struct TasksTabView: View {
    // Managers
    @ObservedObject var fontManager: FontManager
    @ObservedObject var calendarManager: CalendarManager
    @StateObject private var taskManager = EventTaskManager.shared

    // State
    @State private var showingAddTask = false
    @State private var selectedFilter: TaskFilter = .all
    @State private var newTaskTitle: String = ""
    // ... other state variables

    var body: some View {
        NavigationView {
            ZStack {
                VStack {
                    filterTabs          // Filter chips
                    ScrollView {
                        allTasksSection  // Grouped tasks
                    }
                    if showingAddTask {
                        taskEntryView    // Inline task entry
                    }
                }
                if !showingAddTask {
                    floatingPlusButton   // Add button
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### TaskFilter Enum

```swift
enum TaskFilter: String, CaseIterable {
    case all = "All"
    case today = "Today"
    case upcoming = "Upcoming"
    case completed = "Completed"

    var icon: String {
        // Returns SF Symbol name for filter
    }
}
```

### Helper Views

**EventHeaderView**:
- Shows event context for task groups
- Event type icon + title + date/time

**FilterChip**:
- Reusable filter button component
- Shows icon, title, and count badge
- Highlights when selected

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

### 1. General Tasks (Not Event-Linked)

Allow creating tasks not tied to specific events:
```swift
// Add "General" category in EventTaskManager
struct GeneralTask {
    let id: UUID
    var title: String
    // ... task properties
    var linkedEventId: String?  // Optional event link
}
```

### 2. Event Selector for New Tasks

Let users choose which event to attach tasks to:
```swift
// Add event picker in task entry
Picker("Event", selection: $selectedEventId) {
    ForEach(upcomingEvents) { event in
        Text(event.title).tag(event.id)
    }
}
```

### 3. Smart Task Suggestions

AI-powered task suggestions for tasks tab:
```swift
private var aiSuggestionButton: some View {
    Button("‚ú® AI Task Suggestions") {
        // Generate general productivity tasks
        // based on calendar patterns
    }
}
```

### 4. Drag to Reorder

Allow manual task prioritization:
```swift
ForEach(tasks) { task in
    TaskRow(task: task)
}
.onMove { from, to in
    // Reorder tasks
}
```

### 5. Search Tasks

Search across all tasks:
```swift
@State private var searchText = ""

var filteredTasks: [String: [EventTask]] {
    // Filter by search text
}
```

### 6. Task Categories/Tags

Add custom categories beyond event association:
```swift
enum TaskTag: String {
    case work, personal, urgent, waiting
}
```

### 7. Recurring Tasks

Support for repeating tasks:
```swift
struct RecurringTask {
    var interval: RecurrenceInterval
    var endDate: Date?
}
```

### 8. Task Analytics

View task completion statistics:
- Tasks completed this week
- Most productive days
- Average completion time

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Task Creation Behavior

**Current Implementation**:
- New tasks are attached to the next upcoming event
- If no upcoming events exist, task creation fails with warning
- This ensures all tasks are event-associated (per current data model)

**Why This Matters**:
- `EventTaskManager` currently requires an `eventId` for all tasks
- The data model links tasks to events (`allEventTasks: [String: EventTasks]`)
- To support general (non-event) tasks, would need to modify `EventTaskManager`

**Workaround**:
- Could create a "General Tasks" pseudo-event
- Or modify `EventTaskManager` to support `nil` eventId

### Data Persistence

All task data is managed by `EventTaskManager.shared`:
- Tasks persist across app launches
- Stored in UserDefaults or local storage (via EventTaskManager)
- Changes sync automatically via `@ObservedObject` and `@StateObject`

### Event Deletion Impact

If an event is deleted:
- Associated tasks are also deleted
- This is handled by `EventTaskManager`
- Tasks tab will automatically update
