# Smart Suggestion UI Testing Guide

## Quick Start - Testing in Xcode

### Method 1: Add Files Manually to Xcode (Recommended)

1. **Open Xcode**:
   ```bash
   open CalAI.xcodeproj
   ```

2. **Add SmartSuggestionView.swift to Project**:
   - In Xcode's Project Navigator (left sidebar)
   - Right-click on `Features/AI/Views` folder
   - Select "Add Files to CalAI..."
   - Navigate to: `CalAI/Features/AI/Views/SmartSuggestionView.swift`
   - Check "Copy items if needed"
   - Click "Add"

3. **View Live Preview**:
   - Open `SmartSuggestionView.swift` in Xcode
   - Click "Resume" button in Canvas (right side)
   - Or press `‚å•‚åòP` (Option-Command-P)

### Method 2: Test via Playground

You can also create a simple test view:

```swift
import SwiftUI

struct TestSmartSuggestionView: View {
    @State private var showSuggestion = true

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            if showSuggestion {
                SmartSuggestionView(
                    suggestion: mockSuggestion,
                    onAccept: { time in
                        print("Accepted: \(time)")
                        showSuggestion = false
                    },
                    onDismiss: {
                        showSuggestion = false
                    }
                )
                .padding()
            }

            Button("Show Again") {
                showSuggestion = true
            }
        }
    }

    var mockSuggestion: SmartSchedulingService.SchedulingSuggestion {
        SmartSchedulingService.SchedulingSuggestion(
            suggestedTime: Date().addingTimeInterval(86400),
            confidence: 0.85,
            reasons: [
                "Matches your typical meeting time",
                "Good buffer before your 11:30 call",
                "Tuesday is typically a lighter day"
            ],
            alternatives: [
                Date().addingTimeInterval(86400 + 3600),
                Date().addingTimeInterval(86400 + 7200)
            ],
            warnings: nil
        )
    }
}
```

    reasons: [
        "Available time slot",
        "Works for participants"

    reasons: [
        "Available time slot"
    ],
    alternatives: [],

### Scenario 4: Pattern Confidence View üß†

**High Confidence Patterns:**
```swift
PatternConfidenceView(
    patterns: SmartSchedulingService.CalendarPatterns(
        preferredMeetingHours: [10, 14, 16],
        averageGapBetweenMeetings: 900,
        typicalMeetingDuration: 1800,
        busiestDays: [3, 5],
        quietestDays: [2, 6],
        hasLunchPattern: true,
        lunchHourRange: 12...13,

    )
)
```

**Expected:**
- Green "High pattern confidence" pill

// Show pattern view
PatternConfidenceView(patterns: patterns)

// Get suggestion
let suggestion = SmartSchedulingService().suggestOptimalTime(
    for: 1800,  // 30 min
    events: events
)

// Show suggestion
SmartSuggestionView(
    suggestion: suggestion,
    onAccept: { time in

## Known Issues to Watch For

1. **Date Formatting**: Check timezone handling
2. **Long Text**: Test with very long event titles
3. **Many Alternatives**: Test with 3+ alternatives

## Next Steps After Testing

Once UI looks good:

1. ‚úÖ Integrate into AddEventView
2. ‚úÖ Add to AITabView as insights
3. ‚úÖ Connect to real AI suggestions
4. ‚úÖ Add haptic feedback
5. ‚úÖ Polish animations
6. ‚úÖ Add to MorningBriefing
