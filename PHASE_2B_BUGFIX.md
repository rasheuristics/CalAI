# Phase 2B: Bug Fix - CalendarManager Method Call

## Issue Found
After completing Phase 2B integration, discovered that `CalendarManager.getAllEvents()` method doesn't exist.

## Error Messages
```
AddEventView.swift:783:41: Value of type 'CalendarManager' has no dynamic member 'getAllEvents'
AITabView.swift:979:41: Value of type 'CalendarManager' has no dynamic member 'getAllEvents'
```

## Root Cause
CalendarManager uses a `@Published var unifiedEvents: [UnifiedEvent]` property instead of a `getAllEvents()` method.

## Fix Applied ✅

### Before (Incorrect)
```swift
let allEvents = calendarManager.getAllEvents()
```

### After (Correct)
```swift
let allEvents = calendarManager.unifiedEvents
```

## Files Fixed
1. **AddEventView.swift:783** - `generateSmartSuggestion()` function
2. **AITabView.swift:979** - `loadPatternInsights()` function

## Build Status After Fix
✅ **All Swift compilation errors resolved**
⚠️ Only environmental issue remains (AssetCatalogSimulatorAgent - Xcode simulator)

## Verification
```bash
xcodebuild -scheme CalAI build
# Result: 0 Swift errors
# Remaining: Environmental simulator issue only
```

## Impact
- No functional change - just using the correct API
- `unifiedEvents` contains all events from iOS, Google, and Outlook calendars
- This is the proper way to access calendar events in CalendarManager

**Status**: ✅ Fixed and verified
**Build**: ✅ All Swift code compiles successfully
**Ready**: ✅ For testing in Xcode
